					NextGene is a testament to the transformative power of education and innovation in the fight against
					climate change. Our journey commenced in the heart of London, spurred by the collective vision of
					young
					scientists and visionaries from prestigious institutions worldwide, including Cambridge, Oxford,
					Stanford, Harvard, and MIT. Inspired by the urgent environmental crises unfolding globally—from the
					Amazon fires and European heatwaves to the floods ravaging India—we recognized the growing concern
					and
					desire for actionable knowledge among the youth.

				<p>
					Our foundation was built on a crucial realization: while 95% of young people are worried about
					climate
					change, a significant portion questions the adequacy of their education on the matter. This gap
					between
					concern and knowledge sparked our mission to democratize access to scientifically rigorous,
					peer-reviewed climate education, distilled into engaging, bite-sized content. As we embarked on this
					mission, our efforts quickly resonated with a global audience, attracting a dedicated team
					passionate
					about making climate education accessible and understandable for all.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<p>
					Today, NextGene Innovations stands as a beacon of hope and action, growing beyond its initial focus
					to
					encompass a broad spectrum of sustainability and green living education. Through a series of
					strategic
					partnerships, innovative educational programs, and community engagement, we've laid down significant
					milestones. From establishing comprehensive carbon science education systems in schools worldwide to
					launching free educational resources on sustainable development, our achievements are numerous. Yet,
					at
					the core of our efforts is the belief that an informed and engaged youth is the key to unlocking a
					more
					sustainable future.
				</p>

				<p>
					As we continue to evolve, our commitment remains steadfast: to improve climate understanding and
					education globally, fostering a world that rewards curiosity, critical thinking, exploration, and
					learning. A world where everyone is empowered to explore their passions and contribute towards a
					sustainable future. Our story is not just about climate education; it's about creating a world with
					less
					suffering and more opportunity, where the full potential of human problem-solving is unleashed in
					the
					service of the planet.
				</p>

				Join us at NextGene Innovations as we forge ahead, crafting a greener, more sustainable world for
				generations to come. Together, we can turn the tide against climate change and pave the way for a
				brighter, more resilient future. The journey begins here. Join the movement!

					The NextGene team unites over a commitment to low-carbon education. In China, by collaborating with
					the Ministry of Education and the Beijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission, we've
					established an extensive carbon literacy program in schools. This includes integrating low-carbon
					textbooks, audiobooks, and labs, training qualified teachers, and launching a youth carbon
					neutrality innovation competition to boost student engagement. We've formed partnerships with over
					100 schools in the UK and China.
				</p>
				<p>
					To broaden our impact, we partnered with the UAE Ministry of Education to create the Global Green
					Partnership, attracting countries like the USA, UK, France, and Germany. Following the successful
					release of a white paper after COP28, we're preparing to publish a white paper on the outcomes of
					low-carbon popular science education.
				</p>
				<p>
					In April 2024, we're honored to attend the ECOSOC Youth Forum at the United Nations headquarters in
					New York. There, we'll host a forum to amplify the voices of youth and showcase their achievements
					in the low-carbon sector. Our journey highlights the power of youth-led initiatives in driving the
					agenda for a sustainable future.
